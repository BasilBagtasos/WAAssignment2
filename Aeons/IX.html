            <p>IX is an apathetic Aeon, showing little interest in humanity and believing existence is meaningly. IX does not interact with the other Aeons and overall existance remains a mystery. It is recorded that being near IX's form can make one feel "numbed" and "dejected". Due to their belief of nothingness of the multiverse, not much is known on IX. <br></br>
            IX's appearance resembles a large purple blob with two white eyes, a large assortment of asteroids and planets being pulled towards them. What is considered their body is a spinning nebula of stars. <br></br> IX represents the path of Nihility. </p>

            <h2 class="paragraphstart">Nihility</h2>
            <p>It is said those who follow the path of Nihility admire laziness, exhaustion and meaningless behavior. Unfortunately, there is not much to say.</p>
