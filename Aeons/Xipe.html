                Xipe is a collective entity formed from thousands of beings advocating for human harmony and unity, originating from multiple harmonious celestial worlds. During the Swarm Disaster, Xipe absorbed Ena from the Order as their paths converged upon Ena's ascension to Aeonhood.
                <br></br>In terms of appearance, Xipe appears as a serene periwinkle-skinned humanoid with three faces: two on each side of the head and one at the front. Their faces are adorned with circlets and framed by lengthy white curtain bangs, with their hair transitioning from white to dark purple. They emit a bright array of colors behind their head, resembling a halo.
                <br></br>Xipe's body appears to be composed of scattering puzzle pieces, covered by a form-fitting garment adorned with blue and purple cosmic motifs. Their attire includes a long flowing skirt and gold decorations wrapped around their neck and torso
                <br></br>Xipe and their chosen ones have established a harmonious "Family," comprising individuals from diverse civilizations and worlds. This Family represents the closest bond imaginable, where contradictions and disputes are eschewed in favor of eternal love and smiles, believing that only through such unity can the universe achieve true harmony. They regularly reach out to other worlds through their song, encouraging them to embrace harmony. Each time a new world accepts Xipe's blessing, the Family celebrates and redoubles their efforts to praise the kindness of the Aeon. Remarkably, no world has ever grown weary of their singing or willingly abandoned the Path of Harmony.</p>
