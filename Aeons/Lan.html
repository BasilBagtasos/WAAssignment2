            <p>Lan, also going by alias' "The Reignbow Arbiter" and "God of the Skybow", is an Aeon that hold hatred towards <a href="Yaoshi.html" class="hoverable"><u>Yaoshi</u></a> and their monstrous creations that tarnished their homelands, hunting them down. <br></br> Unlike the other Aeons, Lan pays their mind to mortals, appearing before them only to disappear in flash. The only evidence of Lan's presence before them being the trace of the Lux Arrow soaring across the sky.
            <br></br>Lan's appearance is that of a tall, valiant prince with centaur like features, having the body simular to that of a hourse below the waist with the hind legs replaced by wheels to resemble that of a chariot. <br></br>
            The Reignbow Arbiter was not originally a god but instead a mortal anonymous hero of the Xianzhou, that allegedly lead the Xianzhou army against the Heliobi, an enemy faction to the Xianzhou. Lan and a squad was able to defeat the Heliobi, sentencing them to serve as an eternal power source for the Xianzhou. <br> </br>
            Not long after, the Xianzhou encounter <a href="Yaoshi.html" class="hoverable"><u>Yaoshi</u></a> who granted the Xianzhou the ability of immortality through the Ambrosial Arbor. The anonymous hero, rumoured to be Lan, foreshadowed the destruction that this presumed blessing would bring to the land. Failing to warn the Xianzhou, the hero shot at the Ambrosial Arbor which then lead to their arrest and punishment, where they were put into hybernation via cryo-sleep pod. <br></br>
            However, just as predicted, the Ambrosial Arbor transformed the residents of the Xianzhou to creatures. Seeking freedom, the Xianzhou freed the Reignbow from their cryo-pod. The hero then went to the Heliobi where they made a deal that the Heliobi could possess their body in return the hero could use their strength. Upon the Heliobi's acceptance to the deal, the hero would then fired the first sky shattering Lux arrow from his bow, which struck and destroyed the Ambrosial Arbor. After this battle, the hero ascended to Aeonhood where they became Lan, The Reignbow Arbiter and Aeon representing the path The Hunt. </p>
