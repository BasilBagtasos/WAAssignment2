                Qlipoth endeavors to create distance between planets by erecting massive celestial structures known as the Subspace Crystalline Barrier. These barriers shield inhabited worlds from the threat of consumption by their adversaries. The nine original Xianzhou ships observed the creation of one such barrier, named the Echidna Skywall.

                Despite their alignment with the Amber Lord, the IPC (Interplanetary Commerce Commission) defies the wishes of the Aeon by promoting interstellar trade and contact among civilizations. However, they have faced no reprimand for their actions.
                <br></br>In terms of appearance, Qlipoth resembles a legless humanoid composed of rocks and minerals, with a halo positioned behind their head. <br></br>
                During the Swarm Disaster, Ena from the Order extended an invitation to The Preservation, believing Qlipoth held significant responsibility for maintaining universal order as the controller of transmutation's will. An agreement was struck wherein Qlipoth pledged assistance to the Aeons against Tayzzyronth and The Swarm, while the details of Ena's involvement remain undisclosed but likely tied to Oroboros.

                Using their construction hammer, Qlipoth began to weaken Tayzzyronth's form in the presence of Aha and Xipe. As Qlipoth's fury intensified, nearby suns multiplied unusually. With each blow, Qlipoth stripped Tayzzyronth of its essence, ultimately sealing its remnants into separate pieces of amber after reducing it to fragments.</p>
