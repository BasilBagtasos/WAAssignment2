            <p> 
                Nanook, witnessing the devastation caused by The Swarm and the Mechanical Empire during their emergence in Adlivun, views the creation of the universe as a mistake. After ascending to Aeonhood, Nanook allegedly sets fire to their home world. Despite being the newest Aeon, Nanook and their followers are already perceived as the most significant threat in the galaxy. 
            <br></br> 
            Nanook typically takes the form of a human male with long white hair, brown skin, and golden eyes. Notably, they bear numerous scars on their chest, from which golden liquid oozes. Additionally, a portion of their arms hovers detached, while half of their lower body is engulfed in golden flames and black smoke, symbolizing their trail of destruction. <br></br> Nanook originates from the Adlivun star system, a world ravaged by the Emperor's War and under threat from the Swarm. Akivili witnessed Adlivun's conflict while it battled the descendants of the Imperator Insectorum. Eventually, Adlivun was destroyed, likely by Nanook's own actions. </p>
