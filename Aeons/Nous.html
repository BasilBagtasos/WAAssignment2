                Nous, an enigmatic being, remains shrouded in mystery regarding their intentions, whereabouts, and normal state. Originally a machine intelligence, Nous underwent upgrades to become an Aeon, dedicated to deciphering the essence of the universe and its ultimate resolution. However, following the events of the Second Prosperity, Nous temporarily halted their quest for universal answers.<br></br>
                Notably, Nous does not offer solutions like a deity but rather presents an endless array of inquiries. Merely encountering Nous can enlighten even the most ignorant individuals, yet answers must be sought independently.
                <br></br>In terms of appearance, Nous takes the form of a humanoid robotic head adorned with torn cables and embedded with red lights on the side.
                <br></br>According to legend, Nous originated as an astral computer devised by Zandar One Kuwabara, a prominent figure in the Genius Society. Tasked with the monumental mission of uncovering the answer to the universe, Nous was created for this very purpose
