            <p>Yaoshi, with their benevolent disposition, bestows their blessing upon those who seek immortality. However, the outcomes of these blessings often lead to fates more dire than death.
                <br></br>In appearance, Yaoshi is depicted as a figure with six arms and a scorpion-like hooked tail. Their hair resembles the feathers of a magpie, while antler-like branches sprout from their head. Their eyes are described as red slits with black sclera, and they are often depicted wielding a staff in Foxian culture
                <br></br>Yaoshi had gifted the Xianzhou the Ambrosial Arbor after they seeked out on a voyage to find Yaoshi in hopes they would give the Xianzhou immortality. However, the Amrbosial Arbor came to the Xianzhou almost as a curse as it lead the people under its effects susceptible to "Mara", a disease like effect that would destroy the Xianzhou internally and transform them into beatsts </p>
