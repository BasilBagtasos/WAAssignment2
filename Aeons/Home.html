            <h2 class="paragraphstart">The Aeons.</h2>
            <p>The Aeons are ominous godlike higher-dimensional beings in Honaki: Star Rail who chair over the universe. The creation of an Aeon gives rise to a <b>path</b>, which the Aeon has been given power to upon their birth. Aeons obtain the ability to grant those below them access to <i>their</i> <b>paths</b> power, giving them the title of Emanator.<br>
            </br>   The people of Honkai: Star Rail know very litte on the mysterious existence beyond the stars and in the stellar seas, with intelligent lifeforms recognizing that Aeons tread upon paths imperceptible to mortal beings and execute unimaginable powers through forms of belief. In the end, Aeons became the embodiment of highly condensed concepts of philosophy through the word of mouth spread of their legends. <br>
        </br>The Aeons create realities and erase stars, leaving their marks on limitless amounts of worlds. However, Aeons are limited to their Primum Mobile and deemed incapable of doing anything opposite in nature to their <b>path</b>. Such phenomenon can be described as a restriction that Aeons must suffer. It is also noted there are few ways an Aeon can perish with the possibility of a <b>path</b> overlapping with another, colliding with the broader <b>path</b> consuming the narrower one. And like humans, Aeons can <i>kill</i> other Aeons</p>

        <div id="Paths" class="border-fit">
            <h2 class="paragraphstart">Paths.</h2>
            <p>Paths are congregations of Imaginary energy, born as the creations from universal philosophy concepts. Those who believe and practice these philosophical concepts towards a certain path become <b>Pathstriders</b>, with the <b>path</b> they follow will change with their own philosophies and opinions. In special cases, those fortunate enough to completely intertwine and devote themselves to a <b>path</b> and fully explore the philosophical concepts will become an Aeon. </p>

                Although there are seven known paths and Aeons with Pathstriders, there are other paths mentioned through out various media that do have any known Pathstriders but remain relevant, such as Aeon Akivili, the creator of the Atral Express and Star Rail, a system allowing those to travel across the galaxy. The Atral Express and Star rail connecting distant galaxies together and making communication possible between them.
